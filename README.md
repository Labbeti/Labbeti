- ðŸ’¬ Short bio: I am a third year PhD student currently working on Artificial Intelligence for computational analysis of audio events using deep learning methods. My research focuses on **Automated Audio Captioning**, a multimodal task where a system accepts as an input an audio signal and outputs the textual description of the sound events. I am currently working at the <a href='https://www.irit.fr/en/home/'>Computer Science Research Institute of Toulouse</a>, in France.
- ðŸ”­ I am currently writing on my thesis and plan to defend it in 2024.
- ðŸŒ± I am also looking to learn new deep learning tasks, such as spoken language understanding and automatic speech recognition.

- ðŸ’¬ I hold a PhD in Computer Science, with a primary research focus on artificial intelligence applied to audio analysis and natural language processing. My doctoral dissertation concentrated on Automated Audio Captioning, a multimodal task aimed at developing systems capable of generating natural language sentences to describe audio files.
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on the TIRIS-SILENCE project, which aims to study and extract information from audio files recorded in extreme environments such as Mars.
- ðŸŒ± I am also looking to learn new deep learning tasks, such as spoken language understanding and automatic speech recognition.
