- ğŸ’¬ Short bio: I am a third year PhD student currently working on Artificial Intelligence for computational analysis of audio events using deep learning methods. My research focuses on **Automated Audio Captioning**, a multimodal task where a system accepts as an input an audio signal and outputs the textual description of the sound events. I am currently working at the <a href='https://www.irit.fr/en/home/'>Computer Science Research Institute of Toulouse</a>, in France.
- ğŸ”­ I am currently writing on my thesis and plan to defend it in January 2024.
- ğŸŒ± I am also looking to learn new deep learning tasks, such as spoken language understanding and automatic speech recognition.
